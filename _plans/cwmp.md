This plan describes methods of managing runoff and water quality for Columbus' drinking-water reservoirs. The primary ongoing legacy of this plan is the City of Columbus' [Land Stewardship Plan](https://landstewardshipcolumbus.com/communications-updates/), which is primarily oriented towards property owners whos land abuts Big Walnut Creek, the Scioto River, and Columbus' reservoirs. The orignal master plan is hard to track down because of link rot. Consider the following sites to learn the outline of the plan: the consultant [Coldwater Consultants](https://coldwaterconsultants.com/city-of-columbus-water-master-plan-and-land-stewardship-updates/), the consultant [Biohabitats](https://www.biohabitats.com/project/city-of-columbus-watershed-master-plan/), the consultant [OSU's College of Food, Agriculture, and Environmental Sciences' Extension services](https://u.osu.edu/cfaesimpact/2016/03/02/working-to-protect-columbus-drinking-water-while-also-managing-costs/), and [a 2015 archive of the old watershed page](https://web.archive.org/web/20150921213544/https://columbus.gov/watershed/).
