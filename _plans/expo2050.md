Governor Mike DeWine's Expo 2050 Task Force made recommendations for development of the [Ohio Expo Center and State Fairgrounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Expo_Center_and_State_Fairgrounds) and surrounding state-owned properties, including the [Historic Crew Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Crew_Stadium) and the [Ohio History Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_History_Center). Recommendations included new construction within the Fairgrounds, a new entrance gate on 20th Avenue, a new entertainment pavilion, new utility tunnels, and better connections to the stadium and museum. Despite the proximity to future Amtrak service on the Columbus-Cleveland route, the plan does not include provision for passenger rail or even bus transit.
