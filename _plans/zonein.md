Through the [Zone In initiative](https://zone-in-columbus.hub.arcgis.com/), The City of Columbus plans to increase the allowable density of housing in much of Columbus, starting with mixed-use developments along major transit corridors by summer 2024. A second phase will cover the remaining 96% of the City.

This project includes, among other items:

- land use planning
- public art planning
- parking requirements
- building design standards
- light pollution reduction
