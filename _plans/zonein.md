Through the [Zone In initiative](https://zone-in-columbus.hub.arcgis.com/), The City of Columbus plans to increase the allowable density of housing in much of Columbus. A first phase started with mixed-use developments along major transit corridors in summer 2024, and a follow-up along State Route 161. 2025 will include citywide land-use planning, followed by commercial and industrial zones in 2026 and residential neighborhoods in 2027.

This project includes, among other items:

- land use planning
- public art planning
- parking requirements
- building design standards
- light pollution reduction
