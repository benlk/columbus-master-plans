This plan describes how to make the Downtown of the City of Columbus into a 15-minute city, with land-use recommendations and public infrastructure recommendations that will support 40,000 residents by 2040. The plan is sponsored by Downtown Columbus, Inc., which was formed from the merger of the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation and Capital South. Those groups were responsible for the 2010 Downtown Strategic Plan, which led to the redevelopment of the Scioto Peninsula, and for securing significant private funding for [a number of public-space projects](https://downtowncolumbus.com/projects-initiatives/).
