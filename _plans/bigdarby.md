The Big Darby Accord is an interjurisdictional plan for managing water quality in the [Big Darby Creek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Darby_Creek) watershed. The plan touches on runoff, development patterns, water treatment, parkland, and environmental monitoring, among other factors. After initial publication, the planning process was extended in 2007-2011 with the [Town Center planning process](https://www.bigdarbyaccord.org/town-center) designed to develop a vision for a "town center" development along Amity Road between I-70 and West Broad Street.
