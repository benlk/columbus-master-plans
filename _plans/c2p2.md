Many Columbus neighborhoods have adopted local land-use and planning guidelines. For a complete list of these programs, see the Columbus Building and Zoning Services [Document Library](https://www.columbus.gov/Business-Development/Building-Zoning-Services/Boards-and-Commissions/Document-Library), or read the [Columbus Citywide Planning Policies (C2P2) first edition plan](https://www.columbus.gov/files/sharedassets/city/v/1/building-and-zoning/bzs-boards-and-commissions/planning-document-library/columbus-citywide-planning-policies_first-edition_digital.pdf).


Adopted in 2018, C2P2 is still current. However, due to a Columbus.gov refresh that wiped out a lot of content, the best place to find information on this is [in the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20231205155943/https://www.columbus.gov/planning/C2P2/).
