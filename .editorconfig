# > Formatting conventions for your Sails app.
#
# This file (`.editorconfig`) exists to help
# maintain consistent formatting throughout the
# files in your Sails app.
#
# For the sake of convention, the Sails team's
# preferred settings are included here out of the
# box.  You can also change this file to fit your
# team's preferences (for example, if all of the
# developers on your team have a strong preference
# for tabs over spaces),
#
# To review what each of these options mean, see:
